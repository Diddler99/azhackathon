## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet (the cloud), allowing you to store and access data and programs without owning the physical hardware.

### Key Points:
- Internet-based computing
- On-demand access to resources
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
